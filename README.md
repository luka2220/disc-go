# Discord utility bot for software development
The goal of this bot is to integrate Discord with my software development process and my development environment to automate tasks and speed up development


### TODOs
- [ ] Git & Issue Tracker Notifications


### Possible Features
- Git & Issue Tracker Notifications
  - Concept: When you push commits, open PRs, or create issues, the bot sends updates to a relevant Discord channel.
	- Integration:
	-	Use Git webhooks (from GitHub, GitLab, etc.) that call your bot’s endpoint.
	- The bot processes the webhook and posts a summarized message on Discord (author, commit message, issue link).

- Hotkey in Neovim to Summon the Bot for Debugging
  -	Concept: A special keybinding in Neovim that packages up the current function or error message, and sends it to the bot, which either logs it to Discord for group discussion or calls an LLM for suggestions.
	-	Integration:
	-	Local script in Neovim that calls the bot’s HTTP endpoint.
	-	The bot posts a summarized snippet or discussion in a designated channel. 

- AI Pair Programming or ChatGPT Integration
  -	Concept: Connect your bot with ChatGPT or an LLM. Let it read small code snippets from a dedicated channel, then respond with suggestions, bug fixes, or code commentary.
	-	Integration:
	-	Have the bot use the OpenAI (or other LLM) API.
	-	Provide short code context from your local Neovim selection.
	-	Why: Handy for quick code explanations, debugging hints, or generating boilerplate.
 
- Automated Release Notes Generator
  -	Concept: On merging into main or version tagging, the bot gathers commit messages or PR info, builds a quick “release notes” summary, and then posts them in a #release-notes channel.
	-	integration: Use the bot to parse commit messages, format them, and post them as a final summary. Possibly mention changes in a pinned message or via an ephemeral Discord thread.

- Log & Error Aggregation / ChatOps
  -	Concept: The bot acts like a mini log aggregator – on error logs from your application, your bot mentions them in a dedicated channel with potential solutions or links to docs.
	-	Integration:
	-	App logs -> pick up critical/warning level logs -> send them to the bot’s endpoint -> the bot posts an “alert” message on Discord, or performs a “ChatOps” style callback.
	-	Neovim angle:
	-	If you rely on LSP or Neovim for local dev logs, you can forward them to the bot for collaboration with others.
  - Why: It helps you notice errors without digging through logs or big dashboards. Also fosters real-time collaboration.
 
- DevOps Pipeline Alerts
  -	Concept: The bot can display pipeline statuses (CI/CD runs, test results) or deployment events in Discord.
	-	Integration:
	-	If you use a CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI), set up a webhook that notifies your bot about build or deployment results.
	-	The bot posts success/failure notifications, with direct links to logs or artifacts.
	-	Neovim angle:
	-	If you run local tests from Neovim, you could push results to the bot, or the bot could run them on your dev environment using an internal endpoint.
  - Why: Centralize dev pipeline statuses so you and your teammates see immediate pass/fail or logs in a channel.
